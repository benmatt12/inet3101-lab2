#### Parts Record Database allows the user to add new records to a database of parts, delete the most recently added record, view all records within the database, print the number of records, print the size of the database, and print the number of changes made within the database.

#### Once the program is compiled and run, the user is prompted to select between the seven different options. The user should begin by adding record parts to the database, deleting one or two, adding some more, and then viewing all records, for example.

#### printAllRecords() - Prints part number, name size, and cost.
#### addRecord() - Adds a new record to the parts database from user input.
#### deleteLast() - Deletes the most recently added record in the database.
#### sizeOfDatabase() - Prints the size of the database in bytes based on the number of records.

#### Required files - .h header, .c c code, .h stdio, .h stdlib, .h string
